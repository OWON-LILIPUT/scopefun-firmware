# ScopeFun FPGA firmware sources

This is the [Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7.html) firmware source code for ScopeFun.

## Getting started

For comiling the FPGA firmware you must install the [Vivado Design Suite (WebPACK edition)](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html) from Xilinx.

After completing Vivado installation run the "gen_project.tcl" script from Vivado (Tools -> Run Tcl Script). This will create a new project and link ScopeFun sources from "srcs" folder.
